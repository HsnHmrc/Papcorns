## 📊 Key Findings & Insights  

- The top three revenue-generating countries are **U.S., Netherlands, and Turkey**. While this may correlate with customer volume, **other factors** (regional pricing, local competition, etc.) should be analyzed before making strategic moves.  
- The **average order value** ranking mirrors the **earnings ranking**, suggesting a direct correlation. Profitability assessment per country can drive **targeted ad campaigns** for revenue optimization.  
- **TikTok & Instagram** acquisition channels generate **2x more users** compared to organic sources, indicating the **success of our ad campaigns**. Expanding these efforts to **YouTube and X (Twitter)** could **significantly boost revenue**.  
- The **trial-to-customer conversion rate is consistent across all channels**. A **one-time discount for first-time subscribers** (A/B tested over a limited period) could drive **higher conversion rates**.  
- **Customer retention (median: 2-3 months)** could be **extended with periodic small discounts** or a **gamification system (badges & rewards)** to foster engagement and loyalty.

## 📈 Bonus Task: RFM Analysis for Batman (Bruce Wayne) & Superman (Clark Kent)  

Without a predictive model, my manual **RFM analysis** reveals:  

- **Bruce Wayne (Batman, ID:1001)** reached us via **Instagram** and converted **immediately after trial**. This signals **a high likelihood of continued engagement**.  
- **Clark Kent (Superman, ID:1002)** arrived via **organic search** but did not convert at the same rate. **Targeted ad campaigns** or **personalized engagement efforts** may be needed for retention.  

Further data collection could **enhance accuracy** and allow deeper segmentation strategies.

## 📌 Final Recommendations  

✔ Prioritize **targeted ad expansion** (YouTube, X) based on acquisition insights.  
✔ Test **discount-based conversion strategies** for first-time subscribers.  
✔ Introduce **retention-focused incentives** (badges, loyalty rewards).  
✔ Conduct **advanced churn modeling** to refine engagement strategies.
